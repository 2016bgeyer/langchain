New to LangChain? 
Or to LLM app development in general? 
Well, you came to the right place: read this material to quickly get up and running.

[Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Application](use_cases/question_answering/quickstart.mdx)

Combine YOUR data with an LLM to enable natural language question-answering over an arbitrary text dataset.

[Build an Extraction Service](use_cases/extraction/quickstart.ipynb)

LLMs can be used to extract structured data from unstructured text.

[Build a ChatBot](use_cases/chatbots/quickstart.ipynb)

Want to build an application like ChatGPT that can remember what you say and respond to you in a conversational setting?

[Build an Agent](modules/agents/quick_start.ipynb)

Agents use an LLM to interact with tools, deciding when and how to call them.

[Build a Natural Language Layer over a Function](use_cases/tool_use/quickstart.ipynb)

Agents aren't the only way to interact with tools - you can also create a chain that exposes a more simple natural language layer over a tool.

[Build a Query Analysis System](use_cases/query_analysis/quickstart.ipynb)

One of the main parts of RAG is query analysis - using an LLM to construct a query to pass to a retrieval system.

[Build a Question/Answering System over SQL/CSV data](use_cases/sql/quickstart.ipynb)

Not all data is text! Learn how to do question answering over tabular data.
