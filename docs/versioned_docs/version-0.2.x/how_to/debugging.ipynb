    "# How to debug your LLM apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs. A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will cover some few different tools and functionalities that aid in debugging. Some of the examples will use an [Agent](/docs/concepts/#agents) since they use many nested calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "Platforms with tracing capabilities like [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) are the most comprehensive solutions for debugging. These platforms make it easy to not only log and visualize LLM apps, but also to actively debug, test and refine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building production-grade LLM applications, platforms like this are extremely useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Python scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity.\n",

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\\"}]\"\n",

The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95]\\\\nThe production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95]\\\\nA special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \\\\\\\"big-atures\\\\\\\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. He felt that \\\\\\\"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\\\\\\\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \\\\\\\"emotional\\\\\\\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \\\\\\\"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\\\\\\\".[72]\\\\nCasting\\\\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\\\\\\\", while also underscoring that it is a \\\\\\\"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\\\\\\\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \\\\\\\"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\\\\\\\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work.\\\"}]\\nAI: [{'text': 'The 2023 film Oppenheimer was directed by Christopher Nolan.

The film turns on this character’s attempt to move past the boundaries of the technology in order to actually plant an idea in a dreamer’s head. His 2023 film Oppenheimer, depicts J. Robert Oppenheimer’s role in the development of the atomic bomb and the later security hearing over his alleged ties to communism. It used a destabilizing reverse-order story line to mirror the fractured mental state of its protagonist, a man with short-term amnesia who is trying to track down the person who murdered his wife. The Dark Knight (2008) leaned even more heavily on the moral and structural decay of its setting, fictional Gotham City, and it revived such classic Batman villains as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger).\\\"}]\"\n",
